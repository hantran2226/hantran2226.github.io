Welcome Muggles!

Despite her controversial speech against LGTBQ+ friends, J. K. Rowling was a successful author who created the wonderful, magical world that accompanied many of our Gen Z childhoods. When I was younger, I longed to receive an owl mail and attend the spooky and mysterious yet fun and mischievous Hogwarts. Thanks to my nerdy and ambitious nature, I always thought of myself as a Ravenclaw-Slytherin hybrid. I wondered whether the Hat would have a difficult time assigning my house, just like how I could not decide whether I was purely Ravenclaw or purely Slytherin. I pictured my black robes with the house crest, my sycamore wood with dragon heartstring wand, and my possibly feline-shaped animagus. I imagined my late-night adventures with rebellious and mischievous friends, my questionable experiments in charms and potions, my Prefect (eventually Head Girl) badge with little first years surrounding me to ask questions about their homework, and my proud parents waiting for me at the train station each year.

But, I am 24 now, and no owl has come. I have accepted that perhaps, I am a muggle. However, that does not mean I cannot give myself, and my fellow readers, an experience of attending Hogwarts. To take matter into my hand, I decided to re-create magic subjects as muggle subjects, as following:

Herbology = Botany. I am learning herbalism (the study of plants for their medicinal properties).

Care for Magical Creatures = Zoology. I will admit that I have limited knowledge in this field. However, given that my current hobby is gardening, I will focus on insects, including the pollinators and pests.

Potions = General and Organic Chemistry. I can cover up to college-level.

Alchemy = Nuclear Chemistry. I do not have knowledge in this field. Madam Curie was an expert in radioactivity.

Charms = Computer Science. I will cover coding in Python.

Transfiguration = Physics.

Arithmancy = Mathematics. I can cover algebra, trigonometry, geometry, calculus, and statistics. 

Defense Against the Dark Arts = Self-Defense, Weaponry, Forensic Science.

Study of Ancient Runes = Foreign Language and Linguistic. I am learning Spanish and Mandarin.

Apparition = Transportation. I prefer ships/boats.

Astrology = Astrology. Minimal knowledge.

Divination = Astronomy, Tarot, etc. Will not cover.

If you are ready, buckle up, and welcome aboard!
